- [] set reduce number from inputGenrator file, or make inputGenerator and mapreduce job single step
- [] remove third party jar content out, read from hdfs is the best solution
- [] use direct partition
- [] when broker down, do nothing, don't change hdfs
- [] reduce read broker and port from input
